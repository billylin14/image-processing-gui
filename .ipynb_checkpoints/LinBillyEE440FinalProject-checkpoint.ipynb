    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are various effects we can manipulate on images. By manipulating the components of an image, we can achieve different results from the image. In this project, we are interested in applying common effects on images and see how different factors can affect the result of the output images. Specifically, we want to do both image enhancements and filtering to the given images and investigate on the influence of varying the factor. In addition to that, we will also experiment with a more complex effect on the image.\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "In this project, we will implement a simple image enhancement Brightness, and complex filtering, including bilateral blurring and Canny edge detection. Users will be able to play with the effects through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). These effects will each be provided with a slider that can experiment with sliding a factor to adjust the effect. A cartoon effect will also be available to users with a slider to visualize the effect of noise reduction in the carton effect. Lastly, users are allowed to load their desired images to the program and save the result images from the program."

    "## Instructions\n",
    "The program can be executed by running this Jupiter Notebook file alone. However, users will need to first install the required packages listed below to run the program successfully. After opening up the program, users can turn on and off the effects by toggling the buttons on the left panel labeled 0 through 3. Note that the effects will not be saved and will be reset if the user toggles the effect or turns on other buttons. The users will be able to see their effects being erased from the sliders and the output images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Loading and saving can be easily navigated using the load and save buttons with the pop-up windows. The default directory is the \\library subfolder, and the format of saving the image is restricted to .jpg files only. Users do not need to include the extension in naming the output image, but the program can detect whether the users include the extension and will work correctly with either input.\n"

    "## Implementation:\n",
    "* **Bilateral Filter**\\\n",
    "A bilateral filter built-in function in the openCV package is used to achieve bilateral blurring in the program. The built-in bilateral function is provided with three arguments in addition to the image itself. They are (1) kernel size, (2) sigma of space, and (3) sigma of value. The kernel size determines how many pixels will be taken in calculated one result pixel value. The sigmas will determine weight of neighboring pixel values in terms of value and space. Larger the sigmas, larger the weights of neighboring pixel values in determining the result pixel value and thus stronger the effect. In our implementation, we fixed the kernel size to limit the response time and allow users to experiment with the effect with changing sigmas.\n",
    "* **Brightness**\\\n",
    "To adjust the brightness of the given image, we utilize the class \"Brightness\" in the ImageEnhance module of PIL package. The class creates an object from the input image and uses the function \"enhance\" to adjust the image with the given factor. The factor provides -100% effect when assigned 0.0, 0% effect when assigned 1.0, 100% effect when assigned 2.0. \n",
    "In our implementation, the factor is adjusted to lie between 0.0~2.0. The input value from the sliders can vary between -50 to 50. We can offset the value by adding 50 and divide the result by 50 again to obtain the desired range for the factor with slider value of 0 corresponding to 0% effect.\n",
    "* **Canny**\\\n",
    "A Canny edge detection algorithm is summarized in a built-in function in the openCV package. We utilized the function to achieve the Canny edge detection effect. The built-in Canny function is provided with two additional arguments. They are (1) lower threshold, (2) upper threshold. The two threshold values are part of the Hysteresis Thresholding technique in Canny edge detection. Gradients with values higher than the upper threshold are considered as sure-edges. Gradients with values lower than the lower threshold are discarded. Gradients with values in between the two thresholds are determined as edges based on their connectivity with other edges. If the gradients are connected to other edge pixels that are sure-edges, then the gradients are considered as edges. If the gradients are not connected to any edge pixles, then they are discarded. Since Canny edge detection works with only grayscale images, we extract the intensity component of the image and apply the Canny algorithm and merge it back to the original image. The result will retain the original colors since the Canny algorithm does not necessarily produce binary images. In our implementation, we adjust a weight for both thresholds using the slider. Common threshold pairs have a ratio of 1 to 3 for the lower and the upper threshold. The slider provides the base of the threshold values, so the threshold values are determined to be: weight and weight*3.\n",
    "* **Cartoon Effect**\\\n",
    "To achieve the cartoon effect, there are several steps to complete. First, we needed to filter out extra noises and details in the image. We use the median filter function provided by openCV to filter instead of a bilateral filter because we want to avoid blurring the edges but to provide a result with fewer details. Next, a high boost filter is applied using a kernel with size of 3 and a weight of 1. The filter sharpen the edges of the objects in the images. Next, we want to further enhance the edges to produce dark contours for the objects to look cartoon-like. This can be done by AND'ing the image with an binary image of edges. We utilized a built-in function in openCV package called \"adaptiveThreshold\" and another built-in function called \"bitwise_and\" from the same package to achieve what we want to do. With the steps from (1) median filtering, (2) high-boost sharpening, (3) adaptive-threshold edge enhancing, we can obtain a decent result of cartoon effect for the image."

    "During implementation, I was struggling to produce fast response when sliding the kernel size for bilateral effects. After studying, I realized that increasing the kernel size can really affect the runtime because we are convolving a larger kernel for M*N times (assuming the image is MxN). Therefore, I experimented with changing the sigmas and it produced good results. I understand that changing sigmas can be fast because sigmas do not change the number of operations. I also learned that to produce real-time response from effects, we have to limit the operation size we need to perform. It did not affect the median filtering in Cartoon effect because median filtering does not involve 2D convolution. Besides, with the opportunities of implementing different effects with sliders, I was able to visualize how changing sigmas has impacts on the blurring in bilateral filtering, how changing the threshold values can affect the accuracy in edge detection with Canny Algorithm, and how changing the kernel size in median filtering can result in different qualities of the cartoon effect. Lastly, what I learnt the most is using GUI. This was my first time developing a GUI. Although I struggled with aligning the elements, I was able to create a complete and good-looking GUI with simple UIUX."
